            For the present time, as the right to education is being oppressed by the military,
            the IUC developed a virtual online campus to continue delivering education to
            CDM students. The online campus is a Moodle-based learning platform and the
            learning materials are being uploaded. As the outcome-based integrated
            curriculum is not fully developed, the education on the online campus is based
            on the traditional discipline-based curriculum.
