              THE CURRICULUM OF UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS
            </h3>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              The current curriculum is a Traditional discipline-based curriculum, consisting
              of knowledge and attitude acquired on the basis of learning medical courses,
              followed by training for pre-clinical subjects which cover basic medical science
              subjects, public health subjects and legal medicine. Students who pass the
              summative assessments are forwarded to clinical years. Then a one-year
              compulsory internship program ensues. The whole course extends over 7 years.
